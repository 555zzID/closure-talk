Arknights Localization
---

The fallback language of Arknights is _Chinese (Simplified)_.

Translations of Arknights operators are obtained as follows:

- We use [ArknightsGameData](https://github.com/Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData) as source
- We get the list of all operators with their ID and Chinese names from the `zh_CN` (Chinese server) data
- For every operator, we check all other languages (`en_US`, `ja_JP`, `ko_KR`) to find translated names, if available.

Arknights generally have well-organized game data and official translations, although global server translations are several months behind Chinese. The bottom line is that we always have English/Japanese/Korean official translations for **all released operators** in these regions.

## How to Contribute

Currently, we do not accept translations for Arknights, since all translations will eventually be taken care of with game updates.
